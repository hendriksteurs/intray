      Have these scenarios ever happened to you?

    <ul>
      <li> A friend tells you about a film you just have to watch.
      <li> You get a brilliant idea in the middle of a party or meeting.
      <li> You suddenly remember you really need to send someone an email.

    <p .ui>
      Or undoubtedly something similar.
      Never again will you have to drop everything and send the email.
      Never again will you have to put your thought in your calendar, where it does not belong.
      Never again will you forget which films to watch.
      Because now, there is Intray.

        Why can I not modify items?

        <p class="transition hidden">
          Items represent thoughts you have and want to get out of your head.
          The purpose is to not think about the ideas anymore between when you write them down and when you process them.
          During processing, you take the items from Intray and think about what you want to do with each idea.
          After that, you delete the item from the intray.
          Allowing to modify items would open a door for extra stress and it would only allow you to make yourself less efficient.

        Why can I not list all my items?
      <div class="content">
        <p class="transition hidden">
          Only being able to view one item at a time forces you to process items one by one without skipping any.
          This is a proven improvement to your processing speed.

        How do I use Intray with the Self-management coaching?
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          Intray was built specifically to act as the first part in a "Getting Things Done" (GTD) process.
          It is used as the "In basket" in the following flowchart.

        But you said to do lists are bad?
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          Correct.
          Intray is not a to do list.
          It is like a box which contains arbitrary thoughts you want to get out of your head.
          These thoughts still require processing, as opposed to to do items.

        <i class="dropdown icon">
        How is Intray better than any other notes application?
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          Notes or apps such as Remember the Milk, Todoist or Google Keep serve a fundamentally different purpose than Intray.
          Intray items are meant to be short term, ephemeral and for prosessing.
          Notes, on the other hand, have an indeterminate life-time and do not lend themselves well to processing.
          Intray incorporates the best-practices for processing and is not cluttered by unnecessary features.
          Intray has been designed explicitly for your ease of mind and efficiency.

      <div class="title">
        <i class="dropdown icon">
        How is Intray better than org-mode?
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          Intray allows for more efficient processing.
        <p>
          Intray allows you to use a web interface, e.g. through your phone, as well as a command line interface.
          This combination makes intray more efficient to use.

      <div class="title">
        <i class="dropdown icon">
        I don't trust you with my data, can I still use Intray?
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          Yes.
          All data submitted via Intray is secured while it is being submitted and while it is being stored.
          Users will never be tracked and their data will never be exposed to third parties.
          Moreover, Intray is free software, so anyone can host an Intray server themselves.
          The code is available 
          <a href="https://github.com/NorfairKing/intray">
            on Github.

        Will there ever be ads?

        <p>
          There will never be ads on Intray.
          Intray is designed for power users and maximum effiency.
          Any distraction will decrease productivity.
